            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REMARKS Upon the CONTROVERSIE BETWEEN THE <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> COMPANY and the <hi>New</hi> SUBSCRIBERS, Setting forth <hi>The Extreme Difficulty of making the preſent Company the</hi> ROOT <hi>for Carrying on the Future Trade.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Confirming of the preſent Company by Regulation, will, I preſume, by conſequence imply the Neceſſity of a <hi>Valuation</hi> of their Stock, in order to rendring the Trade more extenſive and truly National; for it muſt be confeſt in favour of the greateſt part of the preſent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, that they do not expect an Eſtabliſhment upon the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and poor Foundation they now ſtand, ſince 'tis a larger Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion than they pray for in their Petition, and do themſelves own in their Accompts, that they have not Forty Thouſand Pounds clear Eſtate in <hi>England</hi> to carry on their Trade: Why then the next thing to be conſidered, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, will be, how to value their Stock. This, indeed, may be ſufficient to poſe any thing under Omniſcience; for as 'twas well obſerved by a late Author, their Accompts given into the <hi>Parliament</hi> carried in them the higheſt ſuſpicion of Prevarication and Fallacy; they look like Accompts dreſt up at <hi>Wanſtead,</hi> without recourſe had to their <hi>Accomptant General,</hi> calculated to intrigue the World, and to ſerve a Turn at this Juncture, I ſhall not inſiſt upon this particular, being ſenſible that the Artifice and Impoſture which has been practiſed in this matter, will be repreſented to the <hi>Parliament</hi> in ſo clear a light, as will make it appear a great Aggravation of their other Miſcarriages, to obtrude ſo bold an Impoſition on the great Council of the Land; from which I infer, <hi>That the time which will be ſpent in endeavouring to adjuſt the Valuation of the preſent Company's Stock will be in danger of being loſt, and all Attempts of that nature in human appearance be attended with Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties inſuperable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To what I have been urging, ſome forward Men give ſuch an Anſwer, as will put an end to the Controverſie, if granted them according to their ſuggeſtion. They ſay, That by the aſſiſtance of an Act, they can carry on their Trade without <hi>Valuation</hi> or <hi>Additional Subſcription;</hi> but that Jeſt has been ſo often explained and expoſed, that 'twill need no further Confutation.</p>
            <p>They do of late give out with Pertneſs and Inſolence enough, That they have laid ſuch a Scheme that they cannot fail of carrying the day in defiance of their Adverſaries: but what they mean by that Expreſſion, or what Topiques they uſe, they will not ſo readily acquaint us.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I ſhall only add, that without the help of a <hi>Prophetic Impulſe,</hi> I will not take upon me to divine what will be the iſſue of the preſent Diſpute, but thus much is eaſie to fore-ſee, that ſhould they be ſo fortunate as to have this great <hi>Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Trade</hi> ſetled on them and their Succeſſors, excluſive of their Fellow-Subjects, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Regulation, there are Three Members of this Company, who in Ten Years Trade (computing only after the rate of their Acquiſitions hitherto, and ſuppoſing they will ſtill uſe the ſame Conduct and Management, of which they have not yet forgot the ſweet reliſh) may value themſelves at more than <hi>half a Million of Money each Man,</hi> the the better, for ſo advantageous an Act, <hi>'Twould inveſt them with Eſtates greater than that of many Sovereign Princes, and in a word render them formidable Subjects.</hi>
